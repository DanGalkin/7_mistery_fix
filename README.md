# Quadratic Equations Solver

`quadratic_equation.py` contains the function that solves the quadratic equations for real roots:

1. It returns `None` for the complex solution
2. It returns `None` for second root, if the equation has only one solution.
3. If the equation has two roots, second root is bigger than first.

It is successfully tested by `tests.py` using `unittest`.


# Project Goals
